# backtracing algorithms

usually backtracking questions or algorithms are categorized as :

Question to ask when doing backtracking:

  - does order matter ?


  - Permutations
    - order matters in permutations
    - This questions can be either exhaustive searches or true backtracking
    - usually uses for loop

  - Combinations / Subsets
    - order does not matter
    - all possible selections of a subset from a set of elements
    - use include/exclude approach

recursion:

- base case
- recursive case
  - choose
  - explore
  - un-choose
