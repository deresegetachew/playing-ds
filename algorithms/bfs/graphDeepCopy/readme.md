Given a reference to a node with an undidrected graph, create a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
The copied graph must be completely independent of the original one. This means you need to make new nodes for the
copied graph instead of reusing any nodes from the original path

constraints:

- the value of each node is unique
- every node in the graph is reachable from the given node.
